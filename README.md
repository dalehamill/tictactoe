Tic Tac Toe Android

Coding challenge entry.
Intended to be a simple app, working, and with some UI polish.
Allows for a two player game of X's and O's, multiple player accounts, and tracks stats.
As a bonus, it serializes these stats to a database, and can so stats persist beyond restarts.
I also delved into the scary world of fragments to make the UI a bit more slick.

I hope you enjoy it,
Dale.
